# Grocery List

## About

This project contains code for an online grocery list. Having come from a .NET/Windows backgroud, I'm using this to learn about modern web programming to see whether the newest tools and frameworks can make it easy to program web apps.

## Technology

I'm using **Angular**. I love the functional nature of React but my first priority was a super solid pixel-perfect UI and wanted to use the official Google Angular Material UI components. I also like that Angular provides everything you need in one box and the documentation is pretty good.

I need offline data sync and decided to try **Firebase**. I experimented with AWS Amplify but had a few build problems integrating with Angular. Also Amplify doesn't make it easy (or possible) to provide flexible consumer-based authorization rules.

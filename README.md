# Grocery List (using Angular)

I'm experimenting with Angular to build an online grocery list.

## Technology

Although I really like the simplicity of one-way-data-flow and functional composition in React my top priority is a solid mobile UI framework. The official Angular Material components looks really nice. I also suspect the performance of Angular will be better than React since it doesn't use a virtual DOM.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.4.

AWS Amplify for offline and synchronized data.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

# Grocery List

## About

This project contains code for an online grocery list. Having come from a .NET/Windows backgroud, I'm using this to learn about modern web programming to see whether the newest tools and frameworks can make it easy to program web apps.

## Technology

I'm using **Angular**. I love the functional nature of React but my first priority was a super solid pixel-perfect UI and wanted to use the official Google Angular Material UI components. I also like that Angular provides everything you need in one box and the documentation is pretty good.

I need offline data sync and decided to try **Firebase**. I experimented with AWS Amplify but had a few build problems integrating with Angular. Also Amplify doesn't make it easy (or possible) to provide flexible consumer-based authorization rules.

## Experience log

I'll keep a running log of comments about what I'm enjoying and finding frustrating as I build this web app.

### Hassles

Angular is quite verbose. A single component gets split into 3 files.

### Good stuff

Angular provides everything I will probably need.

Firebase authorization rules are super flexible.

**Can't update Angular CLI to latest version.** TODO

Tried to type `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core` and got this error...

> Package "@angular-eslint/builder" has an incompatible peer dependency to "@angular-devkit/architect" (requires "~0.1001.4 || ~0.1100.1", would install "0.1102.2").

Identified issue at https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint/issues/323
